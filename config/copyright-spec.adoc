// Optional sections include:
//
// - The "Ratified Specifications" section includes one of two mutually

//   Set the :ratified_spec: attribute when generating a specification
//   containing no non-ratified extensions.
//   Do not set this attribute otherwise.
// - The "Successor Specification" section is included when generating a
//   specification derived from a differently named specification (for
//   example, Vulkan is a Successor of OpenGL).
//   Set the :successor_spec: attribute and modify this section as described
//   below if needed.
// - The "Normative Wording" section is included if the Working Group
//   explicitly requests restating of the Khronos Intellectual Property

// "Ratified Specifications" section (two mutually exclusive paragraphs)

// Specifications that contain no non-ratified extensions
ifdef::ratified_spec[]

This Specification has been created under the Khronos Intellectual Property
Rights Policy, which is Attachment A of the Khronos Group Membership
Agreement available at https://www.khronos.org/files/member_agreement.pdf.
Parties desiring to implement the Specification and make use of Khronos
trademarks in relation to that implementation, and receive reciprocal patent
license protection under the Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy
must become Adopters and confirm the implementation as conformant under the
process defined by Khronos for this Specification; see
https://www.khronos.org/adopters .

endif::ratified_spec[]

// Specifications that contain non-ratified extensions
// NOTE: fill in the API name and a link to where it is published below.

ifndef::ratified_spec[]

This document contains extensions which are not ratified by Khronos, and as
such is not a ratified Specification, though it contains text from (and is a
superset of) the ratified [API name] Specification that can be found at
[API link].

endif::ratified_spec[]


// Optional "Successor Specification" section
// NOTE: fill in [insert successor specifications here] below

ifdef::successor_spec[]

This Specification contains substantially unmodified functionality from, and
is a successor to, Khronos specifications including [insert successor
specifications here].

endif::successor_spec[]


// Optional "Normative Wording" section

ifdef::normative_spec_wording[]

The Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy defines the terms 'Scope',
'Compliant Portion', and 'Necessary Patent Claims'.

// NOTE: Replace the asciidoctor "xref-informative" xref below with the
// anchor within this spec, and name of the section discussing informative
// language.

Some parts of this Specification are purely informative and so are EXCLUDED
from the Scope of this Specification.
The <<xref-informative, document conventions section of the Introduction>>
defines how these parts of the Specification are identified.

// NOTE: If this specification has an introductory section discussing
// "technical terminology", and/or a Glossary, replace the corresponding
// terms below with xrefs to those sections.

Where this Specification uses technical terminology, defined in the Glossary
or otherwise, that refer to enabling technologies that are not expressly set
forth in this Specification, those enabling technologies are EXCLUDED from
the Scope of this Specification.
For clarity, enabling technologies not disclosed with particularity in this
Specification (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing technology, hardware
architecture, processor architecture or microarchitecture, memory
architecture, compiler technology, object oriented technology, basic
operating system technology, compression technology, algorithms, and so on)
are NOT to be considered expressly set forth; only those application program
interfaces and data structures disclosed with particularity are included in
the Scope of this Specification.

For purposes of the Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy as it
relates to the definition of Necessary Patent Claims, all recommended or
optional features, behaviors and functionality set forth in this
Specification, if implemented, are considered to be included as Compliant
Portions.

endif::normative_spec_wording[]


// Optional "Normative References" section

ifdef::normative_spec_references[]

Where this Specification identifies specific sections of external
references, only those specifically identified sections define normative
functionality.
The Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy excludes external references
to materials and associated enabling technology not created by Khronos from
the Scope of this Specification, and any licenses that may be required to
implement such referenced materials and associated technologies must be
obtained separately and may involve royalty payments.

// NOTE: make sure that all relevant marks are included, since this list
// grows over time. Trademarks that are not referenced by this Specification
// can be removed.
