// I'm not sure that help would make it go faster, but there are a couple of
// different aspects of "best practices" where having a working example to
// refer to could help:
//
// WG is new to asciidoc and needs help with basic markup / toolchain issues
// - how to they install and run the tools locally, how do they use Khronos
// Docker images, where are the user guides for asciidoc, and so on
//
// WG is out of date WRT licensing & copyright issues (which licenses to use,
// how to express them in code, how to setup a CLA with James' assistance)
//
// WG repository has poorly structured repository (missing boilerplate files
// like CODE_OF_CONDUCT, COPYING, README, etc., or not REUSE-compliant)
//
// WG processes for github engagement aren't well-developed - this one can't be
// addressed just by the existence of an example repository but some repo
// files, like CONTRIBUTING, explain how github engagement works from the point
// of view of the outside developer wanting to contribute.
//
// I'm thinking of having one or more complete mini-specs where the
// "specification language" is just an explanation of what is being done and
// why, so for example the "Introduction" chapter would explain what that is
// and why you want one, and so on. Then the build system would include enough
// comments to explain what each step is and why you want it, the CI scripts
// would explain how they're invoked and the results viewed, and so on.
